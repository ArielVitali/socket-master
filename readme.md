# Protohackers Challenges

## About Protohackers

[Protohackers](https://protohackers.com/) is a casual programming challenge where participants implement servers for various network protocols.

### How It Works:
1. You are given a **network protocol specification**.
2. You **implement the server** according to the spec.
3. You **submit the IP address and port** where your server is running.
4. The **Protohackers system automatically tests** your implementation.
5. Once all tests pass, your **solve time is recorded on a global leaderboard**.

The challenges start **easy** and progressively become **more complex**.
